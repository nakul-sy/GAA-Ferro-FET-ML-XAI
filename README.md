# GAA-Ferro-FET-ML-XAI

A novel combination of machine learning (ML) and eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based prediction is proposed to investigate the variability of nanowire (NW) gate-all-around (GAA) ferroelectric-field effect transistors (Fe-FETs). XAI methods such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and shapley additive explanations (SHAP) enhance the explainability and robustness of ML algorithms for users. The NW-GAA-ferro-FETs show tremendous potential for neuromorphic computing systems and compatibility with complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. The GAA-ferro-FET model is validated using sentaurus technology computer-aided design simulations and experimental data. In this work, the first-ever ML algorithms for NW-GAA-ferro-FETs are proposed, achieving matching physics-based TCAD accuracy with faster learning and lower computational cost. Compared to the ML-based algorithms, conventional emerging devices physics-based simulation requires a high level of device information and a substantial amount of time to provide correct findings and well-fit models. The ML algorithms achieved a R2-score of 99.81%, a low mean square error, and completed average inference in just 12.3 milliseconds, compared to TCAD simulations that would take 400 hours (=17 days) to process 5000 samples. The results indicate that ML models combined with XAI methods have a significant impact. Researchers can receive suggestions and warnings about potential errors before initiating the investigation process, this helps speed up the development of GAA-nanowire-based Fe-FETs for use in aerospace, defence, and space exploration.

Various ML models are implemented using 
  Python (version 3.12.3)
  Scikit-learn (version 1.4.2)
The codes of SHAP and LIME are available here at [https://github.com/nakul-sy/GAA-Ferro-FET-ML-XAI/].
